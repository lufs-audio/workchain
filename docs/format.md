# Workchain Chain and Component File Format

This document specifies the file format for LUFS Workchain chains and components. The format is declared unencumbered; this specification is the reference a competing engine implementation should follow. Where the existing engine's behaviour is a wart, it is noted plainly. Where something is genuinely unspecified, "unspecified" is written rather than invented.

**Source of truth**: `lib/workchain_yaml.py` (Python parser/validator/resolver), `engine/chain-validator.sh` (Bash validation), `lib/workchain_preflight.py` (requirement checking), `lib/workchain_verify.py` (output verification).

## Overview

A Workchain **chain** is a YAML file that sequences named **components** against an input file. Each component is a directory under `components/` containing a `step.yaml` (the component contract) and a `run.sh` (the implementation). The engine resolves parameters, calls `lib/workchain_preflight.py` to verify inbound dependencies, executes `run.sh`, and then calls `lib/workchain_verify.py` to enforce the outbound contract.

---

## Chain File

A chain file is a YAML mapping at the top level. File extension must be `.yaml` or `.yml`.

### Required Fields

The Python validator (`workchain_yaml.py validate`) rejects a chain missing any of these three fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Human-readable chain name. |
| `version` | string or number | Chain version. No format is enforced; use semver strings by convention (e.g. `"1.0"`). |
| `steps` | list | One or more step entries (see below). Must be non-empty. |

The Bash validator (`engine/chain-validator.sh`) checks the same three fields using `grep -qE "^name:"` etc., so fields that appear below a block scalar (see [Limitations](#known-limitations-and-parser-gotchas)) will be missed by the Bash validator even though the Python validator correctly reports them missing.

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `description` | string | Human-readable description. No effect on execution. Must be a single-line quoted string — do not use block scalars (see Limitations). |
| `engine_version` | string | Declares the minimum engine version required. Read and stored for documentation purposes; **not validated or enforced by any current engine code**. |
| `globals` | mapping | Key/value pairs made available to all steps as lower-precedence parameters. Keys that match a component's `params_schema` entry are passed through; others are ignored by the resolver. See [Parameter Precedence](#parameter-precedence). |

### Steps

`steps` is a YAML list of mappings. Each step mapping has:

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Must match the name of a subdirectory under `components/`. The validator checks that the directory exists and contains both `step.yaml` and `run.sh`. |
| `enabled` | boolean | no | Default `true`. Set to `false` to skip this step. The engine logs "Skipping disabled step" and moves on without executing or verifying it. |
| `params` | mapping | no | Per-step parameter overrides. See [Parameter Precedence](#parameter-precedence). |

**Minimal valid chain:**

```yaml
name: "My Chain"
version: "1.0"
steps:
  - name: normalization
```

**Step with all keys:**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: format_conversion
    enabled: true
    params:
      target_format: wav
      sample_rate: 48000
```

---

## Parameter Precedence

The engine resolves the effective parameter set for each step from three sources, in ascending priority:

1. **Schema default** — the `default` value declared in the component's `params_schema` entry.
2. **Chain globals** — values from the chain's `globals` mapping, filtered to keys that are known params of this component. A key in `globals` that does not match any param in the component's `params_schema` is silently dropped.
3. **Step `params`** — values in the step's own `params` mapping. These win over globals and defaults unconditionally.

The resolver (`workchain_yaml.resolve_params`) applies this precedence and passes the merged result to the component as the `STEP_CONFIG` environment block (a flat YAML mapping that `run.sh` reads via `get_param`). The verifier sees the same resolved params via `context.json` under `steps.<name>.params`.

**Legacy alias (normalization only):** if `globals.lufs_target` is set and the step is `normalization` and `target_lufs` is not in the step's own `params`, the resolver copies `globals.lufs_target` to `resolved.target_lufs`. This alias exists for backward compatibility with chains written before the param was renamed.

---

## Component File (step.yaml)

Each component directory must contain a `step.yaml` file. The file is a YAML mapping. All fields are optional unless marked required by the engine's validation path.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | no | Component display name. Defaults to the directory name if absent. |
| `description` | string | no | Human-readable description. No execution effect. |
| `version` | string or number | no | Component version. No format enforced. |
| `type` | string | no | Component category (e.g. `audio`, `image`, `data`). Informational only; the engine does not enforce type compatibility between steps. |
| `input_types` | list of strings | no | File extensions this component accepts (e.g. `[wav, mp3, flac]`). Informational; the engine does not currently gate execution on this. |
| `output_type` | string | no | Primary output type (e.g. `audio`). Informational only. |
| `params_schema` | mapping | no | Parameter definitions. See [`params_schema`](#params_schema). |
| `outputs` | mapping | no | Declared output artifacts. See [`outputs`](#outputs). |
| `requirements` | mapping | no | Inbound dependency declarations. See [`requirements`](#requirements). |
| `verify` | mapping | no | Outbound contract declarations. See [`verify`](#verify). |

---

## params\_schema

`params_schema` is a mapping from parameter name to a parameter definition mapping. The four keys the engine reads from each definition are:

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Data type: `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. Defaults to `string` if absent. Used for type-checking and range enforcement in strict validation mode. |
| `default` | scalar | Default value applied when neither globals nor step params supply a value. A param with no `default` key has no default. |
| `description` | string | Human-readable description of the parameter. No execution effect. |
| `range` | mapping | Numeric bounds: `{min: N, max: N}`. Both keys are optional. Checked in strict validation mode only (`--strict` flag). |

**There is no `required` key in `params_schema`.** The schema has no mechanism to declare a parameter mandatory. Making a parameter mandatory is done by convention: omit `default` from the schema entry and add an explicit guard in `run.sh` that errors out when the value is absent. Example from `format_conversion`:

```yaml
params_schema:
  target_format:
    type: string
    description: "Target format: wav, mp3, flac, ..."
    # no default — run.sh errors: "target_format parameter is required"
  preserve_quality:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: "Preserve sample rate, channels, bit depth"
```

Any keys in a param definition other than `type`, `default`, `description`, and `range` are silently discarded by `component_schema()`.

---

## outputs

`outputs` declares the artifacts a component produces. The engine's `register_output` helper reads `path_template` and `description` from this section and stores them in `context.json`; the verifier uses the names to resolve paths for assertion checks.

### Top-level structure

```yaml
outputs:
  schema_version: "1.0"   # string; currently only "1.0" is defined
  description: "..."       # optional human-readable summary
  items:                   # list of output item mappings
    - ...
```

`schema_version` and `description` are stored for documentation; `schema_version` is not validated against any allowed set.

### Output item fields

Each entry in `items` is a mapping with these keys:

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Identifier used in `verify:` contracts and `context.json`. Use valid identifier characters (letters, digits, underscore). |
| `type` | string | yes | Artifact kind: `file`, `directory`, `json`, `number`, `string`, or `boolean`. |
| `description` | string | no | Human-readable description. Stored in `context.json` by `register_output`. |
| `required` | boolean | no | Declarative annotation. The engine does not currently enforce this automatically — whether a missing required output causes failure depends on the `verify:` contract's `assert` primitives. |
| `mime_type` | string | no | MIME type for file outputs. Stored as metadata; not validated. |
| `path_template` | string | no | Documentation of the output's expected path relative to the output directory. See below. |

### path\_template

`path_template` is a **documentation convention**, not an evaluated template. The engine's `register_output` reads the string from `step.yaml` and stores it verbatim in `context.json` as metadata. It does not substitute placeholders.

The placeholders used in existing components are:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `{input_name}` | Base name of the current input file, without extension. Resolved from `context.json.input_name` by `run.sh`. |
| `{input_ext}` | Extension of the current input file, without leading dot. Resolved from `context.json.input_ext` by `run.sh`. |
| `{target_format}` | The `target_format` parameter value, used in `format_conversion` to express that the output extension follows the requested format. |

These placeholders have no defined substitution mechanism in the engine. Their meaning is purely documentary: each `run.sh` constructs the actual output path itself (typically with Bash variable expansion) and passes the concrete path to `register_output`. A competing implementation may choose to evaluate `path_template` and derive the output path from it, but the current engine does not.

The template path is relative to the output directory (`context.json.output_dir`). A path beginning with `logs/` (e.g. `logs/normalization.json`) conventionally indicates a sidecar file rather than a primary artifact.

---

## requirements

`requirements` is the inbound dependency contract. It is checked by `lib/workchain_preflight.py` before `run.sh` executes. A component with no `requirements` key passes preflight unconditionally.

All dependency classes are optional. A component declares only those it needs.

```yaml
requirements:
  commands: [...]
  python:
    ...
  node:
    ...
  models:
    - ...
  env: [...]
```

### commands

A list of command names. Each is checked with `shutil.which`. Failure halts the step before `run.sh` is called.

```yaml
requirements:
  commands:
    - ffmpeg
    - ffprobe
```

**Note on validation vs. runtime**: In strict validation mode without `--require-commands`, missing commands are reported as `environment` findings rather than errors. A chain is not considered _authoring-invalid_ merely because a required tool is absent from the validating machine. At runtime the engine calls `workchain_preflight.py` unconditionally before each step, and a missing command fails the step.

### python

Declares a component-local Python virtual environment.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `venv` | string | Path to the venv directory, relative to the component directory. Default `.venv`. |
| `python_version` | string | Minimum Python version floor, e.g. `">=3.10"` or `"^3.11"`. Optional. |
| `packages` | list | Python packages to verify by import. Each entry is either a string (import name) or a mapping. |
| `provision` | string | Hint shown to the operator when preflight fails. Not executed automatically. |
| `when` | mapping | Guard: `{param_name: [value, ...]}`. The group is only required when the resolved param matches. Fails closed: if the param cannot be resolved, the group is treated as required. |

Each entry in `packages` is either:
- A plain string: the import module name (e.g. `"soundfile"`).
- A mapping with keys: `import` (module name), `dist` (distribution name for version lookup, defaults to `import` with underscores replaced by hyphens), `version` (version floor, e.g. `">=0.44"`).

Verification imports the module inside the declared venv's Python binary and reads the version via `importlib.metadata`.

```yaml
requirements:
  python:
    venv: ".venv"
    python_version: ">=3.10"
    packages:
      - { import: "audio_separator", dist: "audio-separator", version: ">=0.44" }
      - "soundfile"
    provision: "python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt"
    when:
      backend: [local, auto]
```

### node

Declares Node.js packages, checked via `require.resolve` in the component directory.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `packages` | list | Node packages to verify. Each is a string or a mapping. |
| `when` | mapping | Same guard semantics as `python.when`. |

Each entry in `packages` is either:
- A plain string: the package require name.
- A mapping with keys: `require` (package name) and optionally `version` (version floor).

```yaml
requirements:
  node:
    packages:
      - { require: "jdenticon", version: "^3" }
      - "some-pkg"
```

### models

A list of model artifact declarations. Each entry is a mapping:

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Identifier for logging. |
| `path` | string | Path to the model file. If relative, resolved against the component directory unless `WORKCHAIN_AUDIO_SEPARATOR_MODELS` env var is set, in which case the basename is resolved there. |
| `bytes` | number | Expected file size in bytes. Checked with a 2% tolerance (minimum 1024 bytes). Optional. |
| `sha256` | string | Expected SHA-256 hex digest. Only checked when `--deep` is passed or `always_hash: true` is set. Optional. |
| `optional` | boolean | If `true`, an absent model is a passing check (the model is assumed to be auto-provisioned on first use). Default `false`. |
| `always_hash` | boolean | If `true`, the sha256 is verified on every preflight run, not only with `--deep`. |
| `provision` | string | Hint shown when the model is missing and not optional. |
| `when` | mapping | Same guard semantics as `python.when`. |

### env

A list of environment variable names. Checked for presence only (empty string counts as absent). Values are never read or logged.

```yaml
requirements:
  env:
    - ARTYSHIELD_API_KEY
```

---

## verify

`verify` is the outbound contract. It is enforced by `lib/workchain_verify.py` after `run.sh` exits 0, before the step's output becomes the next step's input. A component with no `verify` key is reported as "unverified" (tier `unverified`) and passes non-blockingly.

```yaml
verify:
  schema_version: "1.0"
  outputs:
    - name: primary_output
      assert: [exists, non_empty, audio_valid]
      json_has: [key1, key2]
  post_conditions:
    - id: my_check_id
      check: audio_lufs_within
      ...
```

### verify.outputs\[\]

Each entry names an output (by the same name used in `outputs.items[].name`) and declares structural assertions against it.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Output name to check. Must match a registered output in context.json. |
| `assert` | list of strings | Structural assertions to run. |
| `json_has` | list of strings | Required top-level keys in a JSON output. Runs after `assert`. |

#### Structural assert primitives (STRUCTURAL dict)

| Assert name | What it checks |
|-------------|---------------|
| `exists` | Path is non-null and `os.path.exists(path)` is true. |
| `non_empty` | File is non-zero bytes; directory has at least one entry. |
| `audio_valid` | `ffprobe` reports at least one audio stream and a positive duration. Requires `ffprobe` on PATH. |
| `json_valid` | File can be parsed as JSON by `json.load`. |

#### json\_has

`json_has` takes a list of key names and fails if any key is absent from the JSON root object. It does not check values; use `json_fields_within` post-condition for value constraints.

### verify.post\_conditions\[\]

Post-conditions are component-level numeric or relational checks. Each entry is a mapping with at minimum:

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Identifier used in the verification report. Falls back to the `check` value if absent. |
| `check` | string | Name of the registered check function (see POST\_CHECKS below). |

Additional keys are specific to each check. The registered checks are:

---

#### audio\_lufs\_within

Re-measures the integrated LUFS of an audio output with `ffmpeg loudnorm` and fails if the measured value is more than `tolerance` LU from the target.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `output` | `"primary_output"` | Output name to measure. |
| `target_param` | `"target_lufs"` | Component param name that carries the target LUFS value. Resolved via the full precedence chain (recorded output metadata > step params > globals > schema default). |
| `tolerance` | `1.0` | Maximum allowed delta in LU (absolute value). |

---

#### audio\_format\_matches

Re-probes an audio output with `ffprobe` and confirms its sample rate, channel count, and/or bit depth match what the step was asked to produce. Fails if no format dimension resolves (empty contract proves nothing).

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `output` | `"primary_output"` | Output name to probe. |
| `sample_rate_param` | — | Component param name that carries the target sample rate. Only asserted if the param resolves to a value. |
| `channels_param` | — | Component param name that carries the target channel count. |
| `bit_depth_param` | — | Component param name that carries the target bit depth. |

Bit depth is read from `bits_per_raw_sample` (authoritative for PCM), with fallback to sample format mapping for codecs that omit it.

---

#### audio\_duration\_matches

Metamorphic invariant: each listed audio output preserves the source file's duration within a tolerance. Intended for separation, denoise, and restoration components where there is no single correct output.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `outputs` | `"auto"` | Output name(s) to check. A string names one output; a list names several; `"auto"` resolves to all file-type outputs except `primary_output`. |
| `exclude` | `["primary_output"]` | Output names excluded from `auto` resolution. |
| `tolerance_s` (also `tolerance`) | `0.1` | Maximum allowed duration difference in seconds. |

Source duration is resolved from recorded output metadata, then from a JSON sidecar's `source_input` field, then from `context.json.input_file`.

---

#### stems\_recombine

Metamorphic relation for source separation: the stems must decompose the input such that their sum reconstructs the source within a residual level threshold.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `stems` | `"auto"` | Stem output names. Same resolution as `audio_duration_matches.outputs`. |
| `exclude` | `["primary_output"]` | Excluded from auto resolution. |
| `max_residual_db` | `-10.0` | The residual (source minus reconstructed mix) must sit at least this many dB below the source mean level. |

---

#### acoustic\_roundtrip

Decodes the output audio with the `audioqr` tool and requires the decoded text to match the source text the step was asked to encode. The decoder is resolved from `WORKCHAIN_AUDIOQR_BIN` env var or `audioqr` on PATH.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `output` | `"primary_output"` | Output name containing the encoded audio. |
| `target_param` | `"text"` | Component param name carrying the source text to recover. |

---

#### seed\_record\_verifies

Runs `lufs-seed verify` against the produced seed record and optionally against the source recording. The verifier is resolved from `WORKCHAIN_LUFS_SEED_BIN` env var or `lufs-seed` on PATH.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `output` | `"primary_output"` | Output name to verify. |
| `require_tier` | `"verified"` | Minimum tier the seed must reach: `"unverified"`, `"verified"`, or `"certified"`. |

---

#### embedding\_wellformed

Checks that a JSON embedding sidecar contains a real, usable vector: declared length, finite values, non-zero, and L2-normed (recomputed, not trusting the stored `l2norm`).

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `output` | `"embedding"` | Output name to inspect. |
| `expect_dim` | — | Required vector dimensionality. If set, fails if the model changed embedding space. |
| `l2_tolerance` | `0.001` | Maximum allowed `|recomputed_norm - 1.0|`. |
| `require_served_by` | — | If set, the record's `served_by` field must equal this value. |

---

#### json\_fields\_within

Declarative value constraint check. Reads a JSON output and evaluates a list of constraint expressions against its fields. Fails on any violation; an empty `require` list fails rather than passing vacuously.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `output` | — (required) | Output name to inspect. |
| `require` | — (required) | List of constraint strings (see grammar below). A single string is also accepted. |

**Constraint grammar:**

Each constraint is a space-separated string of exactly three tokens: `FIELD OP VALUE`.

```
FIELD   ::= dotted.path.to.key    # supports nested JSON objects via dot-separated path
OP      ::= > | >= | < | <= | == | != | is | one_of
VALUE   ::= (depends on OP, see below)
```

Operators and their value forms:

| OP | VALUE | Semantics |
|----|-------|-----------|
| `>` `>=` `<` `<=` | numeric literal | Numeric comparison. The field must be a number. Null fields fail. |
| `==` `!=` | numeric literal or string | Numeric comparison if parseable as float; string comparison otherwise. |
| `is` | kind name | Type/emptiness check. See kinds below. |
| `one_of` | `A\|B\|C` | `str(field_value)` must be in the pipe-separated set. Pipe is used as separator so commas remain legal inside values. |

`is` kind names:

| Kind | Passes when |
|------|-------------|
| `number` | Value is int or float and not a boolean. |
| `string` | Value is a string. |
| `bool` | Value is a boolean. |
| `array` | Value is a list. |
| `object` | Value is a dict. |
| `non_empty` | Value is non-null; for strings, not blank; for lists/dicts, not empty. |
| `not_null` | Value is not None. |

An unparsable constraint is a failure, never a skip (fail-closed). A field absent from the record is a failure.

Example:

```yaml
verify:
  post_conditions:
    - id: probe_plausible
      check: json_fields_within
      output: probe_data
      require:
        - "duration_s > 0"
        - "samplerate >= 2000"
        - "codec is non_empty"
        - "decoder one_of ffmpeg|salvaged-riff"
        - "metadata.channels >= 1"
```

## Known Limitations and Parser Gotchas

The engine runs without PyYAML on a bare system. When PyYAML is unavailable, `workchain_yaml.py` uses a hand-written subset parser (`_MiniYAML`). The Bash validator uses `grep`-based field detection. The following divergences from standard YAML have been reproduced experimentally.

### 1. Block scalars (folded `>` and literal `|`) — stdlib parser silently corrupts the document

**Affected layer:** `_MiniYAML` (Python stdlib fallback). Not affected when PyYAML is installed. The Bash validator is unaffected but gives a false positive (see below).

**Symptom:** Any chain that uses a folded or literal block scalar — for example:

```yaml
# THIS FAILS on a bare system (no PyYAML)
name: my-chain
description: >
  A long description
  spanning multiple lines.
version: "1.0"
steps:
  - name: normalization
```

The `_MiniYAML` parser strips the indented continuation lines as comments or blank lines. The `description` key receives the bare `>` character as its value. The parser then sees `version:` and `steps:` at the correct indent level, so those keys ARE parsed correctly — but `python3 lib/workchain_yaml.py validate` still reports `Missing required field: version` and `Missing required field: steps`.

The error is misleading: the fields are present and syntactically valid, but the `_MiniYAML` parser consumed the block scalar marker `>` as the description value and then — on the engine-plan path — the resulting `data` dict does not pass the validator's `isinstance(data, dict)` check because of how the continuation lines are misinterpreted. The exact failure depends on the indentation structure.

**False positive in Bash validator:** `engine/chain-validator.sh` uses `grep -qE "^version:"` and `grep -qE "^steps:"` to check for required fields. These greps succeed regardless of block scalar usage, so the Bash validator reports "Chain validation passed" for a chain that the Python engine would reject.

**Fix:** Use single-line quoted strings for all `description` fields:

```yaml
description: "A long description spanning multiple lines."
```

This applies to chain files and `step.yaml` files alike.

### 2. YAML anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) — not supported by `_MiniYAML`

**Affected layer:** `_MiniYAML` (Python stdlib fallback). PyYAML handles these correctly.

`&anchor` is included verbatim as part of the scalar value. `*alias` is treated as a literal string, not dereferenced. A chain using anchors/aliases on a bare system will silently produce wrong parameter values — for example, `target_lufs: *tgt` becomes the string `"*tgt"` rather than the anchored value.

**Reproduced output:**

```json
{"globals": {"target_lufs": "&tgt -21"}, "steps": [{"params": {"target_lufs": "*tgt"}}]}
```

**Fix:** Do not use anchors or aliases. Repeat values explicitly.

### 3. Inline comments — not stripped by `_MiniYAML` or the Bash parser

**Affected layer:** Both `_MiniYAML` and `engine/yaml-parser.sh`.

A comment that appears after a value on the same line is included in the value string:

```yaml
name: my-chain  # inline comment
```

`_MiniYAML` parses `name` as `"my-chain  # inline comment"`. The Bash `yaml_get_value` function (`grep | sed`) has the same behaviour. Full-line comments (lines where the first non-whitespace character is `#`) are correctly stripped.

**Fix:** Put all comments on their own lines.

### 4. Multiline flow collections — not supported by `_MiniYAML`

**Affected layer:** `_MiniYAML` (Python stdlib fallback).

A flow sequence or mapping that spans multiple lines is not parsed correctly:

```yaml
# WRONG on bare system
params:
  checks: [
    "format",
    "loudness"
  ]
```

`_MiniYAML` sees `checks: [` as a value of `"["` and interprets `"format",` and `"loudness"` and `]` as additional map entries, producing a broken structure. Flow collections must open and close on the same line:

```yaml
# Correct
params:
  checks: ["format", "loudness"]
```

### 5. Colon in unquoted values — handled correctly (not a limitation)

`_MiniYAML`'s `_parse_map` splits on the **first** colon only (`content.partition(":")`), so `description: Audio: a description` correctly yields `description = "Audio: a description"`. This is safe. Only anchors and block scalars require workarounds.

### Summary table

| Feature | PyYAML | `_MiniYAML` (stdlib) | Bash `chain-validator.sh` |
|---------|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Block scalars (`>`, `\|`) | Supported | **Silently broken** — misleading errors | **False positive** (passes incorrectly) |
| Anchors & aliases | Supported | **Silently wrong values** | Not applicable (field-presence only) |
| Inline comments | Stripped | **Included in value** | **Included in value** |
| Multiline flow `[...]` | Supported | **Broken** | Not applicable |
| Full-line comments | Stripped | Stripped | Not applicable |
| Tabs (converted to 2 spaces) | Handled | Handled | Not applicable |
| Unquoted values with colons | Correct | Correct | Not applicable |

## Annotated Working Example

The following example uses `chains/deliverable-voice.yaml` (a known-working chain) and `components/format_conversion/step.yaml` (a known-working component).

### Chain: chains/deliverable-voice.yaml

*The format is declared unencumbered; third-party implementations are welcome. Implementations should prefer the Python path (`lib/workchain_yaml.py`) as the authoritative parser specification. The Bash components are provided for runtime portability, not as the format reference.*
